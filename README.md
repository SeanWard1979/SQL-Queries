# SQL-Queries
For Achievement #3, The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board asked a series of business questions and expected data-driven answers to use for their 2020 company strategy. The questions had to do with revenue gain for the movies, rental durations, countries Rockbuster customers are based in, and how sales vary between geographic regions.  I answered these questions using SQL queries.
