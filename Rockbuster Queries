I approached this Query with the intention of finding the connection between the number of customers with the country.
Since I could not find any matching fields between them I had to work table to table. 
Within “customer” I found address_id which connects it to “address” which has city_id which connects it with “city” 
which has country_id which brings it to country:

SELECT D.country,
       COUNT(customer_ID)
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 10;

country	            count
India	              60
China	              53
United States	      36
Japan	              31
Mexico	            30
Brazil	            28
Russian Federation	28
Philippines	        20
Turkey	            15
Indonesia	          14


For the next query I attempted to narrow down the top 10 cities in terms of sum within the top 10 countries:  

SELECT city, D. country, SUM(amount)
from customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_ID= E.customer_ID
WHERE country IN ('India', 'China', 'United States',
				  'Japan', 'Mexico', 'Brazil', 
				  'Russian Federation', 'Philippines',
				  'Turkey', 'Indonesia')
GROUP by city, D.country
ORDER by SUM(amount) DESC
LIMIT 10

city	              country	      sum
Cape Coral	        United States	208.58
